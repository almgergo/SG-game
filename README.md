# SG game demo

This is a short demo of an angular FE with login + a game page and a small Java backend to list users and check password.

Use "docker-compose up" in the root directory to run, or individually run the FE and BE. The backend requires a Postgres DB running (easiest from a docker image)

The frontend should be running on "http://localhost:4200" and the backend on "http://localhost:8080"
